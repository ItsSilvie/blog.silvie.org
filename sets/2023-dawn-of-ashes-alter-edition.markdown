## Case differences

The first wave of Dawn of Ashes Alter Edition cases were sealed with clear tape, whilst the second wave were sealed with Grand Archive-branded tape.

## Pack contents

Each Dawn of Ashes Alter Edition booster box contains 24 booster packs, and each booster pack contains 12 cards (288 cards per box).

The cards each pack contains are primarily determined by card rarity, with some extra logic on top to include or exclude specific cards at specific rates.

Cards are determined by their position in the pack, denoted as "slots":

* Slot 1 will always contain a main champion (Lorraine, Rai, Silvie or Zander) weighted by level (see below);
* Slots 2 through 8 will contain a non-duplicate common;
* Slot 9 will either contain a non-duplicate common, a foil (1/8 chance) or a collector ultra rare (1/714 chance);
* Slot 10 and 11 will contain a non-duplicate uncommon;
* Slot 12 will either contain a rare, a super rare (1/4 chance) or an ultra rare (1/24 chance).

The Spirit champions (Spirit of Fire, Water and Wind) are not found in booster packs - these are instead included in box topper packs which contain 2 of each non-foil. The main champions (Lorraine, Rai, Silvie and Zander) are only available as non-foil, with their foil variants being exclusively found in [First Edition](/DOA-1st_(set)).

Non-foil main champion cards will only appear in the first slot of each pack. There is a 1/2 chance this will be a level 1, a 1/3 chance for level 2 and a 1/6 chance for a level 3.

Foil rates are also weighted by rarity, with common cards having the highest chance of being found. There is no duplication logic on the foil card included, meaning it is possible for a pack to contain both the non-foil and foil version of the same card.
